# TODOs

- try WANN-like experiment do GA: eval each genome with 5 random weighting constants
- try experiment with ant and ANNs to see how filled the archive gets
- implement RL based constant optimization (PPO?) 
- do actor-critic for constants (eg SAC) and keep critics through optimization

- add back to weight init
- "variance": jnp.zeros((1,), dtype=jnp.float32),
